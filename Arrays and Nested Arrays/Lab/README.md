## 1.Even Position Element

Write a function that finds the elements at even positions in an array.

The **input** comes as an **array of string** elements.

The **output** is printed on the console. Collect all elements in a string, separated by space.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['20', '30', '40','50', '60']** | **20 40 60** |
| **['5', '10']** | **5** |


## 2.Last K Numbers Sequence

You are given two integers **n** and **k**. Write a JS function that generates and **return** the following sequence:

- The first element is 1
- Every following element equals the **sum** of the previous **k** elements
- The length of the sequence is **n** elements

The **input** comes as **two number arguments**. The first element represents the number **n** , and the second – the number **k**.

The **output** is the **return** value of your function and should be an **array of numbers**.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **6, 3** | **[1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13]** |
| **8, 2** | **[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]** |

#### Explanation

The 2nd element (1) is the sum of the 3 elements before it, but there is only 1, so we take that. The third element is the sum of the first 2 (1 and 1) and the 4th – the sum of 1, 1, and 2. The 5th element is the sum of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (1, 2, and 4) and so on.


## 3.Sum First Last

Write a function that calculates and returns the sum of the first and the last elements in an array.

The **input** comes **as an array of string elements** holding numbers.

The **output** is the **return** value of your function and should be a **number**.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['20', '30', '40']** | **60** |
| **['5', '10']** | **15** |


## 4.Negative / Positive Numbers

Write a JS function that processes the elements in an array one by one and produces a new array. If the current element is a **negative** number you must add it to the **front** of the array ( **as** the **first element** of the array).Otherwise, if the current element is a **positive** number ( **or 0** ), you must add it to the **end** of the array (as the **last element** of the array).

The **input** comes as an **array of number elements**.

The **output** is printed on the console, each element on a new line.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **[7, -2, 8, 9]** | **-2** **7** **8** **9** |
|**[3, -2, 0, -1]** | **-1** **-2** **3** **0** |


## 5.Smallest Two Numbers

Write a function that prints the two smallest elements from an array of numbers.

The **input** comes as an **array of number elements**.

The **output** is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **[30, 15, 50, 5]** | **5 15** |
| **[3, 0, 10, 4, 7, 3]** | **0 3** |

## 6.Bigger Half

You are given an array of numbers. Write a JS function that **sorts** the array in **ascending order** and returns a new array, containing only the **second half** of the input. If there is an odd number of elements in the input, always take the bigger half. For example, if the input array contains 4 elements, the output should be 2, and if the input is 5 – the output is 3.

The **input** comes as an **array of number elements**.

The **output** is the **return** value of the function and should be an **array of numbers**.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **[4, 7, 2, 5]** | **[5, 7]** |
| **[3, 19, 14, 7, 2, 19, 6]** | **[7, 14, 19, 19]** |


## 7.Piece of Pie

Write a function that receives **three parameters** – an **array** of pie flavors as **strings,** two target flavors as **strings**. The result of the function should be a **new array** , containing a section of the original array, **starting** at the first flavor parameter, and **ending** at (and **including** ) the second flavor parameter.

The **input** comes as **three arguments** :

- An **array of strings** , representing pie flavors
- **Two more strings** , representing the start and end of the section, respectively

The **output** is the **return** value of the function and should be an **array of strings**.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['Pumpkin Pie',****'Key Lime Pie',****'Cherry Pie',****'Lemon Meringue Pie',****'Sugar Cream Pie'],****'Key Lime Pie',****'Lemon Meringue Pie'** | **['Key Lime Pie',****'Cherry Pie',****'Lemon Meringue Pie']** |
| **['Apple Crisp',****'Mississippi Mud Pie',****'Pot Pie',****'Steak and Cheese Pie',****'Butter Chicken Pie',****'Smoked Fish Pie'],****'Pot Pie',** **'Smoked Fish Pie'** | **['Pot Pie',** **'Steak and Cheese Pie',** **'Butter Chicken Pie',** **'Smoked Fish Pie']** |


## 8.Process Odd Positions

You are given an array of numbers. Write a JS function that **returns** the elements at **odd**** positions **from the array,** doubled **and in** reverse** order.

The **input** comes as an **array of number elements**.

The **output** is the **return** on the console on a single line, separated by space.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **[10, 15, 20, 25]** | **50 30** |
| **[3, 0, 10, 4, 7, 3]** | **6 8 0** |
