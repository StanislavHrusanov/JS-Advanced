## 1.Print an Array with a Given Delimiter

The **input** comes as two parameters – an **array of strings** and a **string**. The second parameter is the delimiter.

The **output** is the elements of the array, printed on the console, each element **separated** from the others by the **given delimiter**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['One',**  **'Two',**  **'Three',**  **'Four',** **'Five'],**  **'-'** | **One-Two-Three-Four-Five** |
| **['How about no?',**  **'I',** **'will',** **'not',** **'do',** **'it!'],** **'\_'** | **How about no?\_I\_will\_not\_do\_it!** |


## 2.Print Every N-th Element from an Array

The **input** comes as two parameters – an **array of strings** and a **number**. The second parameter is **N** – **the step**.

The **output** is every element on the **N-th** step **starting from the first one**. If the step is **3** , you need to return the **1-st** , the **4-th** , the **7-th** … and so on, until you reach the end of the array.

The **output** is the **return** value of your function and must be an **array**.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['5',**  **'20',**  **'31',**  **'4',** **'20'],**  **2** |**['5', '31', '20']** |
| **['dsa',** **'asd',** **'test',** **'tset'],** **2** | **['dsa', 'test']** |
| **['1',**  **'2',** **'3',** **'4'** **'5'],** **6** | **['1']** |


## 3.Add and Remove Elements

Write a JS function that **adds** and **removes** numbers **to/from** an array. You will receive a command which can either be " **add**" or " **remove**".

The **initial number** is **1**. Each input command should **increase that number** , regardless of what it is.
Upon receiving an " **add**" command you should add the current number to your array.
Upon receiving the " **remove**" command you should remove the last entered number, currently existent in the array.

The **input** comes as an **array of strings**. Each element holds a **command**.

The **output** is the element of the array, each printed on a new line. In case of an empty array, just print " **Empty**".

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['add',**  **'add',**  **'add',** **'add']**| **1** |
|| **2** |
|| **3** |
|| **4** |
| **['add',**  **'add',**  **'remove',**  **'add',** **'add']** | **1** |
|| **4** |
|| **5** |
| **['remove',**  **'remove',** **'remove']** | **Empty** |


## 4.Rotate Array

Write a JS function that rotates an array. The array should be rotated **to the right side** , meaning that the last element should become the first, upon rotation.

The **input** comes as two parameters – an **array of strings** and a **number**. The **second parameter** is the amount of rotation you need to perform.

The **output** is the resulting array after the rotations. The elements should be printed on one line, separated by a **single space**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['1',**  **'2',**  **'3',** **'4'],**  **2** | **3 4 1 2** |
| **['Banana',**  **'Orange',**  **'Coconut',** **'Apple'],**  **15** | **Orange Coconut Apple Banana** |


## 5.Extract Increasing Subset from Array

Write a function that extracts only those numbers that **form a**** non-decreasing subset **. In other words, you start from the** first element **and continue to** the end **of the** given array of numbers **. Any number which is** LESS THAN **the** current biggest one **is** ignored **, alternatively if it's equal or higher than the** current biggest one **you set it as the** current biggest one** and you continue to the next number.

The **input** comes as an **array of numbers**.

The **output** is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subset. Return the **array of numbers**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **[1,**  **3,**  **8,**  **4,**  **10,**  **12,**  **3,**  **2,** **24]** | **[1, 3, 8, 10, 12, 24]** |
| **[1,**  **2,**  **3,** **4]** | **[1, 2, 3, 4]** |
| **[20,** **3,** **2,** **15,** **6,** **1]** | **[20]** |


## 6.List of Names

You will receive an **array of names**. Sort them **alphabetically in ascending order** and print a numbered list of all the names, each on a new line.

**Example**

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **["John", "Bob", "Christina", "Ema"]** | **1.Bob** |
||**2.Christina** |
||**3.Ema** |
||**4.John** |


## 7.Sorting Numbers

Write a function that sorts an **array of numbers** so that the first element is the **smallest** one, the second is the **biggest** one, the third is the **second**** smallest **one, the fourth is the** second ****biggest** one, and so on.

**Return** the resulting array.

**Example**

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **[1, 65, 3, 52, 48, 63, 31, -3, 18, 56]** | **[-3, 65,1,63,3,56, 18, 52, 31, 48]** |


## 8.Sort an Array by 2 Criteria

Write a function that orders a **given array of strings** , by a **length** in **ascending order** as **primary criteria** , and by **alphabetical value** in **ascending order** as **second criteria**. The comparison should be **case-insensitive**.

The **input** comes as an **array of strings**.

The **output** is the elements of the ordered array of strings, printed each on a new line.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['alpha',**  **'beta',** **'gamma']** | **beta** **alpha** **gamma** |
| **['Isacc',**  **'Theodor',**  **'Jack',**  **'Harrison',** **'George']** | **Jack** **Isacc** **George** **Theodor** **Harrison** | **['test',**  **'Deny',**  **'omen',** **'Default']** | **Deny** **omen** **test** **Default** |


## 9.Magic Matrices

Write a function that checks if a given matrix of numbers is **magical**. A matrix is magical if the **sums of the cells** of **every row** and **every column** are **equal**.

The **input** comes as an **array of arrays** , containing numbers (number 2D matrix). The input numbers will **always be positive**.

The **output** is a Boolean result indicating whether the matrix is magical or not.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **[[4, 5, 6],****[6, 5, 4],****[5, 5, 5]]** | **true** |
| **[[11, 32, 45],****[21, 0, 1],****[21, 1, 1]]** | **false** |
| **[[1, 0, 0],****[0, 0, 1],****[0, 1, 0]]** | **true** |


## 10.\*Tic-Tac-Toe

Make a tic-tac-toe console application.

You will receive an array of arrays. As you know there are two players in this game, so the first element of the input will be the first player's chosen coordinates, the second element will be the second player's turn coordinates, and so on.

The initial state of the dashboard is

**[[false, false, false],**

**[false, false, false],**

**[false, false, false]]**

The first player's mark is X and the second player's mark is O.

### Input

One parameter:

- An array - **the moves** in a row that players make

### Output

- There are two players - X and O
- If a player tries to make his turn on already taken place, he should take his turn again and you should print the following message:

**"This place is already taken. Please choose another!"**

- If there are no free spaces on the dashboard and nobody wins the game should end and you should print the following message:

**"The game ended! Nobody wins :("**

- If someone wins you should print the following message and the **current**** state **of the** dashboard**:

**"Player {x} wins!"**

**Note:** When printing the state of the dashboard the elements of each row of the dashboard should be separated by **"\t"** and each row should be on a new line.

### Constraints

The elements in the input array will always be enough to end the game.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **["0 1",** **"0 0",** **"0 2",**  **"2 0",** **"1 0",** **"1 1",** **"1 2",** **"2 2",** **"2 1",** **"0 0"]** | **Player O wins!**|
|| **OXX** |
|| **XOX**|
|| **OfalseO** |
| **["0 0",** **"0 0",** **"1 1",** **"0 1",** **"1 2",** **"0 2",** **"2 2",** **"1 2",** **"2 2",** **"2 1"]** | **This place is already taken. Please choose another!** **Player X wins!**|
|| **X** **X** **X**|
|| **false** **O** **O**|
|| **false** **false** **false** |
| **["0 1",** **"0 0",** **"0 2",** **"2 0",** **"1 0",** **"1 2",** **"1 1",** **"2 1",** **"2 2",** **"0 0"]** | **The game ended! Nobody wins :(** |
||**O** **X** **X** |
||**X** **X** **O** | 
||**O** **O** **X** |
