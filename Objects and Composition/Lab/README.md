# Lab: Objects & Composition

## 1.City Record

You will receive a city's **name** (string), **population** (number), and **treasury** (number)as arguments, which you will need to set as **properties** of an **object** and **return** it.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **'Tortuga',** **7000,** **15000** | **{** **name: 'Tortuga'** **population: 7000,** **treasury: 15000** **}** |
| **'Santo Domingo',** **12000,** **23500** | **{** **name: 'Santo Domingo',** **population: 12000,** **treasury: 23500** **}** |

## 2.Town Population

You have been tasked to create a registry for different **towns** and their **population**.

### Input

The **input** comes as array of strings. Each element will contain data for a town and its population in the following format: **"{townName} \<-\> {townPopulation}"**

If you receive the same town twice, **you should add** the **given population** to the **current one**.

### Output

As **output** , you must print all the towns and their population.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **['Sofia \<-\> 1200000',** **'Montana \<-\> 20000',** **'New York \<-\> 10000000',** **'Washington \<-\> 2345000',** **'Las Vegas \<-\> 1000000']** | **Sofia : 1200000** |
|| **Montana : 20000** |
|| **New York : 10000000** |
|| **Washington : 2345000** |
|| **Las Vegas : 1000000** |
| **['Istanbul \<-\> 100000',** **'Honk Kong \<-\> 2100004'** **'Jerusalem \<-\> 2352344',** **'Mexico City \<-\> 23401925'** **'Istanbul \<-\> 1000']** | **Istanbul : 101000** |
|| **Honk Kong : 2100004** |
|| **Jerusalem : 2352344** |
|| **Mexico City : 23401925** |

## 3.City Taxes

_This task is an extension of Problem 1, you may use your solution from that task as a base._

You will receive a city's **name** (string), **population** (number), and **treasury** (number)as arguments, which you will need to set as **properties** of an **object** and **return** it. In addition to the input parameters, the object must have a property **taxRate** with an initial value of **10** , and three **methods** for managing the city:

- **collectTaxes()**  **-** Increase **treasury** by **population** \* **taxRate**
- **applyGrowth(percentage)**  **-** Increase population by **given percentage**
- **applyRecession(percentage)**  **-** Decrease treasury by **given percentage**

Round down the values after each calculation.

### Input

Your solution will receive three **valid** parameters. The methods that expect parameters will be tested with valid input.

### Output

Return an **object** as described above. The methods of the object modify the object and don't return anything.

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **const city =** **cityTaxes('Tortuga',** **7000,** **15000** **console.log(city);** | **{name: 'Tortuga',population: 7000,treasury: 15000,taxRate: 10, collectTaxes : [Function: collectTaxes],applyGrowth: [Function: applyGrowth],applyRecession: [Function: applyRecession]}** |
| **Testing with code** |
| **Input** | **Output** |
| **const city =** **cityTaxes('Tortuga'** **7000,** **15000);** **city.collectTaxes();** **console.log(city.treasury);** **city.applyGrowth(5);** **console.log(city.population);** | **85000** |
|| **7350** |



## 4.Object Factory

Create a function that can compose objects by copying functions from a given library of functions. You will receive **two**** parameters **– a** library**of functions as an associative array (object) and an**array of orders **, represented as objects**. **You must** return** a new array – the fulfilled orders.

The **first parameter** will be an object where each property is a **function**. You will use this **library of functions** to compose new objects.

The **second parameter** is an **array of orders**. Each order is an **object** with the following shape:

**{**

**template: [Object],**

**parts: string[]**

**}**

A **template** is an object that must be **copied**. The **parts array** contains the names of **required functions** as **strings**.

You must **create and return a new array** , by fulfilling all orders from the **orders array**. To fulfill an order, create a copy of the object's template and then add to it all functions, listed in the **parts array** of the order, by taking them from the **function library** (the first parameter to your solution).

### Input

You will receive two parameters:

- **library** – an object
- **orders** – an array of objects

### Output

Your solution must **return an array** of objects.

### Example

| **Input** |
| --- |
| const **library** = {print: function () {console.log(`${this.name} is printing a page`);},scan: function () {console.log(`${this.name} is scanning a document`);},play: function (artist, track) {console.log(`${this.name} is playing '${track}' by ${artist}`);},};const **orders** = [{template: { name: 'ACME Printer'},parts: ['print']},{template: { name: 'Initech Scanner'},parts: ['scan']},{template: { name: 'ComTron Copier'},parts: ['scan', 'print']},{template: { name: 'BoomBox Stereo'},parts: ['play']}];const products = factory( **library** , **orders** );console.log(products); |
| **Output** |
| [{name: 'ACME Printer',print: [Function: print]},{name: 'Initech Scanner',scan: [Function: scan]},{name: 'ComTron Copier',scan: [Function: scan],print: [Function: print]},{name: 'BoomBox Stereo',play: [Function: play]}] |
